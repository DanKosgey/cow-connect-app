## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
The improved component maintains the same interface but enhances the presentation:

```typescript
interface DetailedBusinessInsightsProps {
  metrics: {
    collectionEfficiency: number;
    farmerRetention: number;
    costPerLiter: number;
    revenuePerFarmer: number;
    qualityIndex: number;
    seasonalTrend: number;
  };
}
```

### Calculated Metrics
New metrics derived from existing data:
- Profit Margin = ((revenuePerFarmer - costPerLiter * 100) / revenuePerFarmer) * 100
- ROI = (revenuePerFarmer / costPerLiter) * 100

### Industry Benchmarks
Added for comparison:
- Cost per Liter: Ksh 75.00 (industry average)
- Revenue per Farmer: Ksh 14,000.00 (industry average)
- Profit Margin Target: 20%
- ROI Target: 150%

## Testing

The component has been tested for:
- Data accuracy with various metric values
- Responsive design across different screen sizes
- Color contrast accessibility
