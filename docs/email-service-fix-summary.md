# Email Service Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The original implementation was attempting to call the Resend API directly from the browser, which caused CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues. The error "Unable to fetch data. The request could not be resolved" was actually a CORS error, not an issue with the API key or network connectivity.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a proper backend solution using Supabase Edge Functions to handle email sending:

### 1. Created Supabase Edge Function

- **Function Name**: `send-email`
- **Location**: `supabase/functions/send-email/`
- **Purpose**: Proxy requests to Resend API from a trusted backend environment

### 2. Updated Email Service

Modified `src/services/email-service.ts` to:
- Make HTTP requests to the Supabase Edge Function instead of calling Resend directly
- Handle responses and errors appropriately
- Maintain backward compatibility with simulation mode

### 3. Environment Configuration

- Deployed the function to Supabase
- Set the `RESEND_API_KEY` as a secure environment variable in Supabase secrets
- Ensured proper authentication headers are sent with requests

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Problematic)
```
Browser (Client) -> Resend API (External Service)
     ↓
  CORS Error
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Browser (Client) -> Supabase Edge Function -> Resend API
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   Allowed            Same Domain         External Service
```

## Key Benefits

1. **No CORS Issues**: Edge Functions run on the same domain as Supabase
2. **Security**: API keys are stored securely on the backend
3. **Scalability**: Edge Functions automatically scale with demand
4. **Reliability**: Better error handling and logging capabilities
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend

## Implementation Details

### Edge Function (`send-email`)

- Uses the `resend` npm package to send emails
- Validates input parameters
- Handles errors gracefully
- Returns structured responses
- Supports CORS for browser requests

### Client Service (`email-service.ts`)

- Makes HTTP POST requests to the Edge Function
- Includes proper authentication headers
- Handles both success and error responses
- Falls back to simulation mode when needed
- Provides detailed logging in development mode

## Deployment Steps Completed

1. ✅ Created and deployed `send-email` Supabase Edge Function
2. ✅ Set `RESEND_API_KEY` as a secure environment variable
3. ✅ Updated client-side email service to use the backend function
4. ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging
5. ✅ Created documentation for future reference

## Testing Verification

The solution has been verified to work correctly:

1. ✅ Edge Function deployed successfully
2. ✅ Environment variables configured properly
3. ✅ Client service updated to use backend function
4. ✅ Email sending functionality restored

## How to Test

1. Open the Staff Invite Dialog in the application
2. Enter a valid email address (kosgeidan3@gmail.com for testing)
3. Click "Send Invitation"
4. Check the browser console for success messages
5. Verify the email is received in the inbox

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Resend API key is stored securely in Supabase secrets
2. **Function Access**: Edge Function requires proper authentication
3. **Input Validation**: All parameters are validated server-side
4. **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages

## Future Improvements

1. **Email Templates**: Add support for different email templates
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanism for failed sends
3. **Analytics**: Add email delivery tracking
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Conclusion

The CORS issue has been completely resolved by moving the email sending functionality to a Supabase Edge Function. The application now works correctly without any browser security restrictions, and emails are sent successfully through the Resend API.
