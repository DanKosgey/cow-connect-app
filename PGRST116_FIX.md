# PGRST116 Error Fix

## Problem
The error message "PGRST116 Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object" indicates that the application is making requests to a PostgREST backend with an Accept header that specifies `application/vnd.pgrst.object+json`. This header tells PostgREST to return the result as a single JSON object rather than an array, which is the default behavior. However, the query executed by PostgREST returned either zero or more than one row. Since PostgREST cannot represent zero or multiple rows as a single JSON object, it throws this error with a 406 Not Acceptable status code.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by using the `.single()` method in Supabase queries. When a query with `.single()` returns zero rows or more than one row, it triggers the PGRST116 error.

## Solution
I've fixed all instances of the `.single()` method by replacing it with proper error handling that checks for the existence of data before accessing it.

### Files Fixed

1. **RouteManagement.tsx** - Replaced `.single()` with `.limit(1)` and added proper data validation
2. **EnhancedCollectionForm.tsx** - Replaced `.single()` with `.limit(1)` and added proper data validation
3. **EnhancedPerformanceDashboard.tsx** - Replaced `.single()` with `.limit(1)` and added proper data validation
4. **ProtectedStaffRoute.tsx** - Replaced `.single()` with `.limit(1)` and added proper data validation
5. **CompleteRegistration.tsx** - Replaced `.single()` with `.limit(1)` and added proper data validation
6. **FarmerRegistration.tsx** - Replaced `.single()` with `.limit(1)` and added proper data validation
7. **PaymentSystem.tsx** - Replaced `.single()` with `.limit(1)` and added proper data validation

### Pattern Used
Instead of:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('table')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', someId)
  .single();

if (error) throw error;
// Directly use data (unsafe)
```

The fix uses:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('table')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', someId)
  .limit(1);

if (error) throw error;

// Check if we have any data
if (!data || data.length === 0) {
  throw new Error('No data found');
}

const record = data[0];
// Safely use record
```

## How the Fix Works
1. **Removes `.single()` method** - This prevents PostgREST from trying to force a single object response
2. **Uses `.limit(1)`** - This ensures we only get at most one record from the database
3. **Adds data validation** - Checks if data exists before accessing it
4. **Maintains the same functionality** - The application logic remains the same, but with proper error handling

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Test all components that were using `.single()` method
2. Ensure they still work correctly when data exists
3. Ensure they handle cases where no data is found gracefully
4. Check that no PGRST116 errors occur

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing a utility function for safe single record fetching
- Add more comprehensive error handling for different types of database errors
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient database issues
