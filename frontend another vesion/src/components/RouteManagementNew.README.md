# Route Management Component

## Overview
The Route Management component provides staff members with tools to manage their daily collection routes, including route visualization, optimization, and real-time tracking.

## Features Implemented

1. **Route List View**
   - Displays all assigned routes with status indicators
   - Shows route details (duration, distance, number of stops)
   - Allows selection of routes for detailed management

2. **Route Details**
   - Farmer list with location coordinates
   - Collection history indicators
   - Route status tracking (planned, active, completed)

3. **Route Optimization**
   - Optimization by distance, time, or priority
   - Visual feedback on estimated savings
   - Integration with backend optimization service

4. **Route Execution**
   - Start/complete route functionality
   - GPS tracking integration
   - Real-time location updates

5. **Map Visualization**
   - Farmer location markers
   - Route path visualization
   - Current location tracking

6. **Export Functionality**
   - Route data export (CSV/PDF)

## Integration Points

1. **API Service**
   - Uses `RoutesAPI` for route management
   - Requires endpoints for:
     - `/routes/staff/{staff_id}/routes` (GET)
     - `/routes/{route_id}/start` (POST)
     - `/admin/routes/{route_id}/optimize` (PUT)

2. **React Query**
   - Uses `useQuery` and `useMutation` for data fetching and mutations
   - Implements automatic caching and refetching

3. **Google Maps Integration**
   - Uses `useLoadScript` hook for Google Maps loading
   - Requires `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable

4. **UI Components**
   - Uses shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Select, Badge, etc.)
   - Uses Lucide React icons

## Usage

```tsx
import RouteManagement from '@/components/RouteManagementNew';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <RouteManagement />
  );
};
```

## Data Requirements

The component expects the following data structure:

```typescript
interface RouteData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  assigned_staff: string;
  farmers: FarmerLocation[];
  estimated_duration: number;
  total_distance: number;
  status: 'planned' | 'active' | 'completed';
  scheduled_date: Date;
}

interface FarmerLocation {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  location: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
  };
  collection_history?: {
    last_collection_date?: string;
    avg_volume?: number;
    quality_grade?: string;
  };
}
```

## Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes and shadcn/ui components for styling. All colors and styling follow the existing design system.

## Testing

Unit tests are provided in `RouteManagementNew.test.tsx` covering:
- Loading state
- Error state
- Data display
- Route selection

## Storybook

Storybook stories are available in `RouteManagementNew.stories.tsx` for component development and documentation.
