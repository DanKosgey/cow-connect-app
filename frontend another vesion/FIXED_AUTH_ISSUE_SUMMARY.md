# Fixed Authentication Issue Summary

## Problem
The frontend was continuously making requests to `/api/v1/auth/me` resulting in 401 errors and causing a reloading behavior when connected to the server.

## Root Cause
1. The FarmerPortal component was continuously trying to fetch farmer data even when authentication failed
2. The authentication check mechanism was making repeated requests without proper rate limiting
3. The secureStorage's getCurrentUser method was being called too frequently
4. The API service was retrying authentication requests, causing continuous 401 errors

## Fixes Applied

### 1. FarmerPortal Component (src/pages/FarmerPortal.tsx)
- Added proper error handling in the useEffect hook to prevent continuous data fetching attempts
- Added a delay before redirecting on authentication failure to prevent rapid redirects
- Updated the dependency array to include all necessary dependencies

### 2. AuthContext (src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx)
- Added rate limiting to authentication checks
- Implemented a cooldown period between authentication attempts
- Added visibility change listener to prevent unnecessary checks when the tab is not active

### 3. SecureStorage (src/utils/secureStorage.ts)
- Added cooldown period to prevent too frequent authentication requests
- Enhanced error handling in the refreshAndRetry method
- Improved logging for debugging authentication issues

### 4. ApiService (src/services/ApiService.ts)
- Reduced retry attempts for authentication requests to prevent continuous 401 errors
- Added graceful error handling for the getMe function
- Improved error logging for debugging purposes

## Testing
After applying these fixes, the continuous reloading behavior should be resolved. The application will now:
1. Check authentication status only when necessary
2. Properly handle authentication failures without continuous retries
3. Redirect to login page with appropriate delays
4. Prevent excessive requests to the authentication endpoints

## Additional Recommendations
1. Consider implementing a more robust session management system
2. Add proper offline handling for better user experience
3. Implement WebSocket-based authentication status updates for real-time session management
