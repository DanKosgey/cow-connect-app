# Route Management Fix

## Problem
The RouteManagement component was failing with the error:
```
Could not find a relationship between 'staff_routes' and 'routes' in the schema cache
```

This happened because:
1. The database schema was missing the `routes`, `collection_points`, and `route_points` tables
2. The `collections` table was missing the `collection_point_id` field
3. The `staff_routes` table didn't have a foreign key relationship to the `routes` table
4. The type definitions referenced non-existent tables or missing fields

## Solution
I've implemented a comprehensive fix that includes:

### 1. Database Migration
Created a new migration file `20251006_add_missing_route_tables.sql` that adds:
- `routes` table - stores route information
- `collection_points` table - stores collection point locations with GPS coordinates
- `route_points` table - junction table linking routes to collection points with sequence numbers
- Adds `collection_point_id` field to the `collections` table
- Updates to `staff_routes` table to add `route_id` foreign key

### 2. Type Definitions
Updated both type files to match the actual database schema:
- `database.types.ts` - Added definitions for the new tables and updated collections table
- `staff.types.ts` - Updated references to use actual table names

### 3. Component Updates
Updated the RouteManagement component to work with the new schema:
- Uses proper table relationships
- Queries collections by date range instead of assuming today's collections
- Uses the RPC function to get assigned farmers
- Properly maps collection data to route points

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the database migration:
   ```sql
   -- This will be automatically applied when you deploy the new migration file
   ```

2. The RouteManagement component should now work correctly with real data.

## Future Enhancements
The current implementation provides a foundation for route management. Future enhancements could include:
- Adding map visualization
- Real-time route optimization
- Collection point analytics
- Route performance tracking
- Integration with GPS tracking for staff
