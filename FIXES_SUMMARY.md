# Fixes Summary

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing "row-level security policy" violations when attempting to upload documents during the farmer registration process. This was causing the error:
```
StorageApiError: new row violates row-level security policy
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by attempting to upload files to Supabase storage before the user was properly authenticated. The registration flow was:

1. User fills out registration form
2. User uploads documents (ERROR OCCURRED HERE - user not authenticated yet)
3. User submits form
4. Account is created and user is authenticated
5. Database records are updated

Since the user wasn't authenticated during step 2, the Supabase RLS policies prevented the upload.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Service Worker Fix
- Fixed the service worker caching issue by implementing proper error handling in the `addAll` method
- Removed non-existent assets from the static assets list
- Added individual error handling for each asset to prevent complete failure when one asset fails

### 2. File Upload Process Redesign
- Modified the FarmerRegistration component to store files locally without immediate upload
- Moved the actual file upload process to occur after user authentication
- Updated the UI to reflect that files are "selected" rather than "uploaded" during the form filling process

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added specific error messages for different types of upload failures:
  - Bucket not found errors
  - Row-level security policy violations
  - General upload errors
- Enhanced user feedback with more descriptive error messages

### 4. Path Structure Correction
- Fixed incorrect file path construction that was causing double bucket name prefixes
- Ensured proper path structure: `{national_id}/{timestamp}-{document_type}.{extension}`

## Changes Made

### Service Worker (`public/service-worker.js`)
- Implemented robust caching with individual error handling
- Removed `/favicon.ico` from static assets (file doesn't exist)
- Improved error logging for failed cache operations

### Farmer Registration Component (`src/pages/FarmerRegistration.tsx`)
- Redesigned file upload flow to defer actual uploads until after authentication
- Added `uploadedPath` property to track successfully uploaded files
- Modified UI text to accurately reflect the file selection vs upload status
- Enhanced error handling with specific messages for different error types
- Fixed file path construction to prevent double bucket name prefixes

### Configuration Documentation
- Created `STORAGE_CONFIGURATION.md` with proper Supabase storage setup instructions
- Created `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md` documenting previous performance improvements
- Created this `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` to document the current fixes

## Testing Verification
To verify the fixes:

1. Ensure Supabase storage is properly configured with the `kyc-documents` bucket
2. Apply the RLS policies as documented in `STORAGE_CONFIGURATION.md`
3. Test the farmer registration flow:
   - Fill out the registration form
   - Select documents (should show "Document selected" message)
   - Submit the form
   - Documents should upload successfully after authentication

## Security Considerations
- Files are now uploaded only after proper user authentication
- RLS policies are properly enforced
- Error messages don't expose sensitive system information
- File validation (type, size) is maintained

## Performance Impact
- No negative performance impact
- File uploads now occur during the natural flow after account creation
- Service worker caching is more robust and won't fail completely due to single asset issues
