# Farmer Registration Flow Implementation Summary

## Current Implementation Status

The farmer registration flow is already implemented according to your requirements:

### 1. Farmer signs up → Email confirmation sent
✅ **Implemented**: The EnhancedFarmerSignup component collects all farmer information and calls `FarmerRegistrationService.startRegistration()` which:
- Creates a Supabase auth account with `emailRedirectTo: '/auth/callback'`
- Stores pending registration data in localStorage
- Sends email confirmation automatically

### 2. Farmer confirms email → Profile set to "pending" status
✅ **Implemented**: When farmer clicks email confirmation link:
- AuthCallback page processes the confirmation
- Redirects to KYC pending approval page
- AuthContext.processPendingProfile() creates farmer record with:
  - `kyc_status: 'pending'`
  - `registration_completed: false`

### 3. Farmer uploads KYC documents
✅ **Implemented**: 
- CompleteRegistration page allows document uploads
- Documents are stored in kyc_documents table with `status: 'pending'`
- Admin notifications are sent when documents are uploaded

### 4. Admin reviews and approves KYC
✅ **Implemented**:
- KYC Admin Dashboard shows all pending farmers
- Admins can view uploaded documents
- Admins can approve/reject applications using RPC functions
- Approval updates farmer's `kyc_status` to 'approved'

### 5. Farmer can then log in successfully
✅ **Implemented**:
- FarmerLogin page checks KYC status after login
- Only farmers with `kyc_status: 'approved'` can access dashboard
- Farmers with pending/rejected status are redirected appropriately
