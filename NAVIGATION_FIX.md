# Navigation Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing navigation issues where users couldn't go back to previous pages after navigating to other pages. The browser's back/forward buttons were not working properly.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect route configuration in React Router v6. The nested routes were using absolute paths instead of relative paths, which caused conflicts with the router's history management.

## Solution
I've fixed the navigation issues by updating the route configuration in all route files:

### 1. App.tsx
- Removed the future flags from BrowserRouter which were causing compatibility issues
- Simplified the router configuration to use standard React Router v6 behavior

### 2. Route Files (staff.routes.tsx, admin.routes.tsx, farmer.routes.tsx)
- Changed route paths from absolute (e.g., "/staff/dashboard") to relative (e.g., "dashboard")
- Updated the default route handling to use empty path ("") instead of "/"
- Fixed the wildcard route to redirect properly

### 3. Route Structure
The updated structure properly uses React Router's nested routing:
- App.tsx defines the main route prefixes (/staff/*, /admin/*, /farmer/*)
- Each route file defines relative paths that are appended to the prefix
- This allows proper history management and back/forward navigation

## How the Fix Works
1. When a user navigates to /staff/dashboard, React Router:
   - Matches /staff/* in App.tsx
   - Loads StaffRoutes component
   - Matches "dashboard" within StaffRoutes
   - Renders the StaffDashboard component

2. Browser history is properly maintained because:
   - Each navigation creates a new history entry
   - The back/forward buttons work as expected
   - Route parameters and state are preserved

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to different pages within the same role (e.g., staff dashboard → collections → farmers)
2. Use the browser's back button to return to previous pages
3. Use the forward button to navigate forward again
4. Refresh pages and ensure navigation still works

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing a custom navigation history manager for more complex navigation patterns
- Add navigation breadcrumbs for better user experience
- Implement proper scroll restoration on navigation
