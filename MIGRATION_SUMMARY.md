# Database Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the database migrations that have been created and deployed to improve the performance, data integrity, and functionality of the dairy management application.

## Migrations Created

### 1. Add Missing Indexes and Constraints
**File:** `20251013200000_add_missing_indexes_and_constraints.sql`

**Purpose:** 
- Add missing indexes on foreign key columns for better performance
- Add check constraints for data validation
- Add updated_at triggers for tables that were missing them

**Changes:**
- Added indexes on foreign key columns in multiple tables (collections, payments, farmers, staff, user_roles, etc.)
- Added check constraints to ensure positive values for liters, rate_per_liter, and amount
- Added phone number format validation for farmers and profiles
- Added updated_at triggers for tables that were missing them

### 2. Enhance Staff Table and Function
**File:** `20251013210000_enhance_staff_table_and_function.sql`

**Purpose:**
- Enhance staff table with additional fields for better staff management
- Create helper functions for staff record initialization
- Update the assign-role Edge Function to properly populate enhanced staff records

**Changes:**
- Added status column with check constraint (active, inactive, suspended)
- Added department column for staff organization
- Added position column for staff roles
- Added hire_date column with default to CURRENT_DATE
- Added supervisor_id column with foreign key reference to staff table
- Created indexes on new columns for better query performance
- Created generate_employee_id function for consistent employee ID generation
- Created initialize_staff_record function for proper staff record initialization
- Created get_staff_details function for retrieving staff information with user details

## Edge Functions Updated

### Assign-Role Function
**File:** `supabase/functions/assign-role/index.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added CORS support with proper headers
- Enhanced staff record creation with additional fields (department, position, hire_date, status)
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added validation for role values

## Migration Execution Status

### Test Environment
- ✅ Migrations executed successfully in local test environment
- ✅ Edge Functions deployed and tested
- ✅ Basic functionality verified

### Production Environment
- ⏳ Migrations pushed to remote database
- ⏳ Verification pending due to connectivity issues

## Verification Plan

### Post-Migration Verification Steps
1. Verify all new indexes are created
2. Confirm all constraints are active
3. Check that triggers are working
4. Validate that Edge Functions work with new schema
5. Test application functionality with new schema

### Key Tables to Verify
- invitations - Check table structure, indexes, and RLS policies
- user_roles - Check RLS policies for proper role assignment
- staff - Check enhanced structure with new columns and indexes
- collections - Check new indexes and constraints
- payments - Check new indexes and constraints

## Rollback Procedures

If any issues are discovered after migration:

1. Identify the problematic migration
2. Use the rollback SQL provided in each migration file
3. Restore from backup if necessary
4. Investigate and fix the issue
5. Retry the migration after fixes

## Next Steps

1. Complete verification of migration in production environment
2. Monitor application performance with new indexes
3. Test all functionality that uses the enhanced staff table
4. Validate that invitation and role assignment workflows work correctly
5. Update documentation to reflect new database schema
