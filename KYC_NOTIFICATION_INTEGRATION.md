# KYC Notification Integration

This document describes the integration between farmer registration, KYC document submission, and admin notifications in the DAIRY FARMERS OF TRANS-NZOIA system.

## Overview

The system now provides real-time notifications to administrators when farmers complete their registration and upload KYC documents. This ensures that admins are immediately aware of new applications that require review.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Notification Service Enhancement

The notification service has been enhanced with a new method to send notifications to all administrators:

```typescript
async sendAdminNotification(title: string, message: string, category: string = 'kyc'): Promise<void>
```

This method:
- Queries the database for all active admin users
- Creates notification records for each admin
- Handles errors gracefully to prevent registration failures

### 2. Document Upload Notifications

When farmers upload KYC documents through the CompleteRegistration page:
- After each successful document upload, admins receive a notification
- When registration is completed (all documents uploaded), admins receive a final notification
- Notifications include the farmer's name and document type for context

### 3. Real-time Admin Dashboard Updates

The KYC Admin Dashboard now includes:
- Real-time subscriptions to farmer and document changes
- Automatic refresh when new farmers register or upload documents
- Toast notifications for immediate awareness
- Visual indicators for pending applications

### 4. Notification Content

Notifications follow these patterns:
- **Document Upload**: "New KYC Document Uploaded: [Farmer Name] has uploaded a [Document Type] for KYC verification."
- **Registration Complete**: "Farmer Registration Completed: [Farmer Name] has completed their registration and uploaded all KYC documents. Please review their application."

## Technical Implementation

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Awareness**: Admins are notified instantly when new applications require attention
2. **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard automatically refreshes with new data
3. **Improved Workflow**: Reduces time between farmer registration and admin review
4. **Better User Experience**: Farmers receive confirmation that their documents are being processed
5. **Audit Trail**: All notifications are stored in the database for future reference

## Testing

- Notifications are sent correctly
- Dashboard updates in real-time
- Registration flow is not disrupted by notification failures
- Error handling works properly
- Performance impact is minimal
