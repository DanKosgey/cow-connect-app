# Session Timeout and Data Loading Issue Solution

## Problem Description

Users were experiencing issues where:
1. After staying on a page for more than 10 seconds, they couldn't reload the page
2. When changing pages, data failed to load
3. This was likely due to Supabase session timeouts and connection issues

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Short Session Timeout**: The original implementation had a 30-minute session timeout
2. **Disabled Session Persistence**: Session persistence and auto-refresh were disabled in Supabase config
3. **No Automatic Session Refresh**: No mechanism to automatically refresh sessions
4. **No Connection Recovery**: No handling for connection drops or session expiration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Supabase Client Configuration

Updated `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`:
- Enabled session persistence (`persistSession: true`)
- Enabled automatic token refresh (`autoRefreshToken: true`)
- Added connection monitoring
- Increased timeout values

### 2. Improved Authentication Context

Updated `src/contexts/SimplifiedAuthContext.tsx`:
- Increased session timeout to 2 hours
- Reduced session validation frequency to every 5 minutes
- Added manual session refresh capability
- Improved caching duration from 5 to 10 minutes

### 3. Created Session Refresh Hook

Created `src/hooks/useSessionRefresh.ts`:
- Automatic session refresh every 10-15 minutes
- Refresh on page visibility change (when user switches back to tab)
- Refresh on window focus
- Proper error handling and logging

### 4. Updated Dashboard Components

Updated key dashboard components to:
- Use the session refresh hook
- Automatically refresh sessions before data fetching
- Handle connection issues gracefully

## Key Features of the Solution

### Automatic Session Management
- Sessions are automatically refreshed every 10-15 minutes
- Additional refresh when user returns to the tab or window
- Prevents unexpected session expiration

### Improved Error Handling
- Better logging of session and connection issues
- Graceful degradation when sessions expire
- Clear error messages for users

### Enhanced User Experience
- No more "frozen" pages after inactivity
- Smooth page transitions even after long periods
- Automatic recovery from connection issues

## How It Works

1. **Session Refresh Hook**: 
   - Runs automatically every 10-15 minutes
   - Refreshes when user returns to the tab
   - Refreshes when window regains focus

2. **Proactive Session Management**:
   - Dashboard components refresh sessions before data fetching
   - Prevents timeout errors during data operations

3. **Connection Monitoring**:
   - Logs session state changes
   - Monitors connection health
   - Provides detailed error information

## Configuration Options

The `useSessionRefresh` hook accepts these options:
```typescript
interface UseSessionRefreshOptions {
  enabled?: boolean;        // Enable/disable the hook (default: true)
  refreshInterval?: number; // Refresh interval in ms (default: 15 minutes)
}
```

## Testing the Solution

1. **Session Persistence Test**:
   - Stay on a page for 30+ minutes
   - Navigate to other pages
   - Verify data loads correctly

2. **Tab Switching Test**:
   - Switch to another tab for 10+ minutes
   - Return to the application
   - Verify session is still active

3. **Connection Recovery Test**:
   - Simulate network disconnection
   - Restore connection
   - Verify automatic session recovery

## Benefits

✅ **No More Timeout Issues**: Sessions are automatically maintained
✅ **Improved Reliability**: Automatic recovery from connection issues
✅ **Better User Experience**: Seamless navigation even after inactivity
✅ **Reduced Support Requests**: Fewer timeout-related user complaints
✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Better visibility into session issues

## Future Improvements

1. **Network Status Monitoring**: Add offline/online detection
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add service worker for offline capabilities
4. **User Notifications**: Inform users of session refresh activities
