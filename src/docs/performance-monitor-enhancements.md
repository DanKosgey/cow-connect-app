# Performance Monitor Enhancements

## Problem Description

The application was encountering a `TypeError: performanceMonitor.startTiming is not a function` error. This occurred because the code was trying to call methods (`startTiming` and `endTiming`) that didn't exist on the performanceMonitor object.

## Root Cause

The original performanceMonitor implementation only had basic methods for tracking dashboard loading times:
- `startFetch()` / `endFetch()`
- `startProcessing()` / `endProcessing()`
- `startRender()` / `endRender()`

However, other parts of the application (specifically `SimplifiedAuthContext.tsx` and `database-optimizer.ts`) were trying to use:
- `startTiming(name: string): string`
- `endTiming(id: string, name?: string): number | null`

These methods were missing from the implementation.

## Solution

Enhanced the `PerformanceMonitor` class in `src/utils/performanceMonitor.ts` to include the missing methods:

### New Methods Added

1. **`startTiming(name: string): string`**
   - Creates a new timing entry with a unique ID
   - Records the start time using `performance.now()`
   - Returns the unique ID for later reference

2. **`endTiming(id: string, name?: string): number | null`**
   - Finds the timing entry by ID
   - Records the end time
   - Calculates and logs the duration
   - Returns the duration in milliseconds or null if not found

### Implementation Details

```typescript
interface TimingEntry {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number | null;
}

private timings: Map<string, TimingEntry> = new Map();
private timingCounter: number = 0;

startTiming(name: string): string {
  const id = `timing_${++this.timingCounter}_${name}`;
  this.timings.set(id, {
    id,
    name,
    startTime: performance.now(),
    endTime: null
  });
  return id;
}

endTiming(id: string, name?: string): number | null {
  const timing = this.timings.get(id);
  if (timing) {
    timing.endTime = performance.now();
    const duration = timing.endTime - timing.startTime;
    console.log(`[Performance] ${timing.name}: ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms`);
    return duration;
  }
  return null;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### In Authentication Context
```typescript
const id = performanceMonitor.startTiming('initializeAuth');
try {
  // ... authentication logic ...
} finally {
  performanceMonitor.endTiming(id, 'initializeAuth');
}
```

### In Database Operations
```typescript
const id = performanceMonitor.startTiming(`cachedQuery-${cacheKey}`);
try {
  const result = await queryFn();
  return result;
} finally {
  performanceMonitor.endTiming(id, `cachedQuery-${cacheKey}`);
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Fixes Runtime Errors**: Eliminates the `TypeError` that was preventing proper authentication
2. **Detailed Performance Tracking**: Provides granular timing for specific operations
3. **Consistent API**: Maintains the same interface expected by existing code
4. **Informative Logging**: Automatically logs timing results to the console
5. **Memory Efficient**: Uses a Map for efficient storage and retrieval of timing entries

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Load the admin login page
2. Attempt to log in
3. Check the console for performance timing logs
4. Confirm that no `TypeError` errors appear
5. Verify that authentication completes successfully

The performance monitor now provides both the original dashboard timing functionality and the new granular operation timing functionality.
