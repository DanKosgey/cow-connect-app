# KYC Upload Page Debugging

This document outlines the debugging steps and findings for the KYC upload page issue.

## Current Status

The KYC upload page is not displaying properly. Based on the logs:
1. User is authenticated as a farmer
2. ProtectedRoute is allowing access to the page
3. Navigation to `/farmer/kyc-upload` is working
4. But the page content is not being displayed

## Hypotheses

1. **Database Query Issue**: The component might not be finding the pending farmer record
2. **Early Return Conditions**: One of the early return conditions might be triggered
3. **Component Rendering Issue**: There might be an error preventing the component from rendering

## Debugging Steps Taken

1. **Added Enhanced Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to the EnhancedKYCDocumentUpload component
2. **Fixed Status Filtering**: Updated the database query to include more statuses
3. **Created Test Component**: Created a test component to check what data exists for the user

## Test Component

The TestKYCFarmerData component will help us understand:
1. What pending farmer records exist for the user
2. What farmer records exist in the farmers table
3. Whether there's a data issue preventing the KYC upload page from loading

## How to Use

1. Navigate to `/farmer/test-kyc-farmer-data`
2. Check the console logs for detailed information
3. Review the displayed data to understand what records exist

## Next Steps

1. Check the output of the test component to see what data exists
2. Based on the findings, determine if the issue is with data or component logic
3. Fix the underlying issue and verify the KYC upload page works correctly
