# Variance Reporting Dashboard Usability Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the usability testing plan for the enhanced Variance Reporting Dashboard. The purpose of this testing is to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of users when interacting with the redesigned dashboard.

## Test Objectives
1. Evaluate the intuitiveness of the new UI/UX design
2. Assess the effectiveness of data visualization components
3. Measure user satisfaction with performance and responsiveness
4. Identify any usability issues or areas for improvement
5. Validate that all features work as intended

## Test Participants
- **Target Users**: Admin users, dairy managers, data analysts
- **Number of Participants**: 5-8 users
- **Selection Criteria**: 
  - Regular users of the variance reporting system
  - Mix of technical and non-technical backgrounds
  - Experience with similar dashboard interfaces

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Daily Monitoring
**Objective**: User wants to monitor daily variance metrics
**Tasks**:
1. Log into the admin dashboard
2. Navigate to the Variance Reporting section
3. View today's variance summary
4. Identify any significant variances (>5%)
5. Export today's data to CSV

### Scenario 2: Performance Analysis
**Objective**: User wants to analyze collector performance
**Tasks**:
1. Access the Variance Reporting Dashboard
2. Filter data for the last 30 days
3. Sort collectors by performance score
4. Identify top 3 and bottom 3 performers
5. View detailed information for one collector

### Scenario 3: Trend Investigation
**Objective**: User wants to investigate variance trends
**Tasks**:
1. Open the Variance Reporting Dashboard
2. Select a specific date range (e.g., last quarter)
3. Analyze the trend charts
4. Drill down into a specific date with high variances
5. Compare with previous period data

### Scenario 4: Data Export and Reporting
**Objective**: User wants to generate a report for management
**Tasks**:
1. Access the dashboard
2. Apply relevant filters (date range, collector, variance type)
3. Export filtered data to Excel
4. Print the dashboard view
5. Save the filter configuration for future use

## Evaluation Metrics
