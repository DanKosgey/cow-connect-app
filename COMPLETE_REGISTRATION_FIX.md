# CompleteRegistration Component Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The CompleteRegistration component was failing to load with the error:
```
TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:5173/src/pages/CompleteRegistration.tsx
```

## Root Cause

The component was trying to import a non-existent `LoadingContext` from `@/contexts/LoadingContext`. The correct hook was available at `@/hooks/useLoading`, but the import statement was incorrect.

## Fix Applied

1. **Updated Import Statement**: 
   - Removed incorrect import: `import { useLoading } from "@/contexts/LoadingContext";`
   - Added correct import: `import useLoading from "@/hooks/useLoading";`

2. **Verified Usage**: 
   - Confirmed that the usage of the `useLoading` hook was already correct in the component
   - The hook was being used properly with `startLoading()` and `stopLoading()` functions

## Verification

1. **File Structure**: 
   - Confirmed that `useLoading.ts` exists in the hooks directory
   - Confirmed that there is no `LoadingContext.ts` in the contexts directory

2. **Import Validation**:
   - Verified that `useLoading` is properly exported as a default export from the hook file
   - Confirmed that the import syntax matches the export pattern

3. **Development Server**:
   - Restarted the development server to clear any caching issues
   - Server is now running successfully on port 5175
   - Component should now load without import errors

## Impact

This fix resolves the lazy loading error for the CompleteRegistration component, allowing farmers to complete their registration process by uploading KYC documents after email confirmation.
