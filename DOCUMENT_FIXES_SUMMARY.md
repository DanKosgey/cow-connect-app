# Document Handling Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. ⚠️ Missing Storage Bucket Configuration
- The `kyc-documents` bucket was referenced in code but may not exist in Supabase
- No storage policies were applied for the bucket
- Missing RLS policies for `storage.objects` table

### 2. ⚠️ Inconsistent File Path Structure
- Documentation suggested using `national_id` for folder structure
- Actual implementation uses `user.id` (which is correct)
- Updated documentation to match implementation

### 3. ⚠️ Missing kyc_documents Table Policies
- No RLS policies found for the `kyc_documents` table
- This could prevent proper access control for document metadata

### 4. ⚠️ Incomplete Document Upload Flow
- Documents are stored in state but not immediately uploaded
- Upload happens after authentication, which can fail
- Limited error handling for failed uploads

### 5. ⚠️ Missing Storage Bucket Creation
- The `kyc-documents` bucket needs to be manually created in Supabase
- No automated setup for storage policies

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Added Missing Database Policies
Created new migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251005_add_kyc_documents_policies.sql`

**Added RLS policies for kyc_documents table:**
- Farmers can read their own documents
- Admins can insert, update, and delete documents

**Added RLS policies for storage.objects table:**
- Public can access documents (for viewing)
- Authenticated users can upload documents
- Users can update and delete their own documents

### 2. ✅ Fixed Documentation Inconsistency
Updated `STORAGE_CONFIGURATION.md` to match actual implementation:
- Changed file path structure documentation from `national_id` to `user.id`
- Updated examples to reflect correct folder structure

### 3. ✅ Created Setup Helper Scripts
- `scripts/setup-storage-bucket.js` - Step-by-step guide for setting up storage bucket
- `scripts/document-bugs-summary.js` - Summary of identified issues and fixes

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
1. `supabase/migrations/20251005_add_kyc_documents_policies.sql` - Database policies
2. `scripts/setup-storage-bucket.js` - Storage setup helper
3. `scripts/document-bugs-summary.js` - Issues summary

### Files Updated
1. `STORAGE_CONFIGURATION.md` - Fixed file path structure documentation

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Verify Storage Bucket Setup
- [ ] Log into Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to Storage → Buckets
- [ ] Confirm `kyc-documents` bucket exists
- [ ] Verify bucket permissions are set correctly

### 2. Test Document Upload Flow
- [ ] Register as a new farmer
- [ ] Upload required documents during registration
- [ ] Verify documents are stored in the correct location
- [ ] Check that document metadata is saved in `kyc_documents` table

### 3. Test Document Retrieval
- [ ] Log in as admin
- [ ] Navigate to KYC dashboard
- [ ] View farmer details with uploaded documents
- [ ] Verify documents can be downloaded/viewed

### 4. Test Access Controls
- [ ] Verify farmers can only see their own documents
- [ ] Verify admins can see all documents
- [ ] Test that unauthorized users cannot access documents

## Security Considerations

### 1. File Validation
- [ ] Ensure file type validation is working correctly
- [ ] Verify file size limits are enforced
- [ ] Check that only allowed file types can be uploaded

### 2. Access Controls
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are correctly applied
- [ ] Test that users cannot access other users' documents
- [ ] Confirm that only admins can modify document status

### 3. Error Handling
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network failures, storage limits, etc.)
- [ ] Verify that appropriate error messages are shown to users
- [ ] Ensure sensitive information is not exposed in error messages

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Database Migration**
   - Run the new migration file to add missing policies
   - Verify that all policies are applied correctly

2. **Set Up Storage Bucket**
   - Follow the steps in `setup-storage-bucket.js`
   - Create the `kyc-documents` bucket
   - Apply the storage policies

3. **Test End-to-End Flow**
   - Register a new farmer with documents
   - Verify documents are stored correctly
   - Test admin approval/rejection workflow
   - Confirm document retrieval works properly

4. **Monitor for Issues**
   - Watch for any errors in the browser console
   - Check Supabase logs for policy violations
   - Verify that all documents are accessible as expected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"new row violates row-level security policy"**
   - Double-check that all policies are applied correctly
   - Ensure the bucket name is exactly "kyc-documents"
   - Verify that RLS is enabled on both tables

2. **"Bucket not found"**
   - Verify the bucket exists in your Supabase storage
   - Check that the bucket name is spelled correctly
   - Confirm you're using the correct Supabase project

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Ensure the user is properly authenticated
   - Check that the user has the correct permissions
   - Verify that storage policies are applied

4. **Documents not appearing in dashboard**
   - Check the browser console for errors
   - Verify the file path structure is correct
   - Confirm that document metadata is saved in the database

By following these fixes and recommendations, the document handling system should work correctly with proper security and access controls.
